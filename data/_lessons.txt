The best way out is always through.<br/>If there is no struggle, there is no progress.<br/>Courage is like a muscle. We strengthen it by use.<br/>More is lost by indecision than wrong decision.<br/>Worry is a misuse of imagination.<br/>A year from now you'll wish you had started today.<br/>Somewhere, something great is waiting to be known.
If you see someone without a smile,<br/>give them one of yours.<br/>It always seems impossible until it is done.<br/>Keep your face to the sunshine<br/>and you cannot see a shadow.<br/>The only time you fail is when you fall down<br/>and stay down.<br/>It makes a big difference in your life<br/>when you stay positive.<br/>The way i see it, if you want the rainbow,<br/>you gotta put up with the rain.
